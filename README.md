# Telco-Churn-Classification

his project involves building a binary classifier to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company. Customer churn occurs when a customer stops using the services provided by the company. By predicting churn, the company can take proactive measures to retain customers.

Key Features:
Dataset: The dataset contains information about customers, including demographics, services they have subscribed to, and their payment details.
Objective: Build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will churn based on their attributes.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features related to customer behavior, demographics, and account information. The features are used to train the model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not.

Main Columns:
CustomerID: A unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: Customer's gender (Male/Female).
SeniorCitizen: Whether the customer is a senior citizen (0: No, 1: Yes).
Tenure: The number of months the customer has stayed with the company.
MonthlyCharges: The amount charged to the customer each month.
TotalCharges: The total amount charged to the customer.
Churn: Target variable (Yes/No) indicating whether the customer has churned.
Preprocessing Steps:
Handling Missing Data: Missing values are handled appropriately, including imputation where necessary.
Label Encoding: The categorical columns such as Gender and Churn are label-encoded to convert them into numerical format.
Scaling: Numerical features such as MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges are scaled using either Min-Max Scaling or Standardization to bring them to a similar range.
Visualizations:
Several plots, such as the ROC curve, are included to visualize the model's performance and understand the trade-offs between the false positive rate and the true positive rate.
Model Building
Multiple machine learning algorithms are applied to the preprocessed dataset to predict customer churn. The focus is on improving model accuracy through hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and evaluation using metrics such as AUC-ROC.

Steps Involved:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, encoding, and scaling the dataset to prepare it for model training.
Model Selection: Various classification algorithms are applied to the dataset, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC (Area Under the Curve) to assess performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the selected model to optimize performance.
Libraries Used:
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development and evaluation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing data trends and model performance.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Results
The final model is evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Precision: The number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives.
Recall: The number of true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false negatives.
ROC-AUC Score: A measure of the ability of the model to distinguish between classes.
